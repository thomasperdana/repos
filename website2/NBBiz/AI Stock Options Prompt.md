#1 Quality Stock Check Prompt

I am an investor conducting a fundamental analysis of [STOCK_NAME] to evaluate its investment potential over the next 10 years. Your task is to provide a comprehensive analysis based on the following requirements, using the most recent and reliable data available (e.g., financial reports, industry analyses, or real-time web searches if needed). If data is unavailable, make reasonable assumptions and clearly note them. Follow the steps below and present the results in a clear, structured format with citations where applicable.
Market Size and Total Addressable Market (TAM):
Estimate the current market size and TAM for the industry [STOCK_NAME] operates in.
Assess whether the TAM is high-growth (e.g., projected CAGR > 10% over the next 5-10 years) and provide supporting data or trends.
Market Leaders and Market Share:
Identify the top 3-5 publicly traded companies leading the industry, including [STOCK_NAME] if applicable.
Provide their estimated market share (as a percentage of total industry revenue) based on recent data.
List the annual revenue (TTM or most recent fiscal year) for each leader.
Economic Moat of [STOCK_NAME]:
Analyze the economic moat of [STOCK_NAME] (e.g., network effects, brand strength, patents, cost advantages, or switching costs).
Assess the moat’s durability (e.g., likely to last 5, 10, or 20+ years) and explain how it protects market share and profitability.
Revenue and Net Margin History (Last 5 Years):
Create a table showing [STOCK_NAME]’s annual revenue and net profit margin for the last 5 years (2020-2024 or most recent available).

#2 Option Selling Trade Selection Prompt

I am an options trader looking to determine the best option-selling strategy based on current market conditions. Your goal is to analyze the market by asking me a series of targeted questions about key market indicators and then recommend whether I should sell at-the-money (ATM) options with 60+ days to expiration (ideal market conditions) or out-of-the-money (OTM) options with 7 days to expiration (less ideal/worst market conditions). Follow these steps:
Ask Questions About Market Indicators: Ask me up to 5 concise, relevant questions to assess the current market conditions. Focus on critical indicators such as:
Market volatility (e.g., VIX level or recent volatility trends).
Overall market trend (bullish, bearish, or range-bound).
Implied volatility (IV) relative to historical volatility (HV) for the underlying asset.
Liquidity and trading volume of the underlying asset or options.
Any significant upcoming events (e.g., earnings, economic reports, or geopolitical developments). Ensure the questions are clear and specific, allowing me to provide precise data or observations.
Analyze the Inputs: Based on my answers, evaluate whether the market conditions are ideal (stable, high implied volatility, favorable trends) or less ideal/worst (high uncertainty, low liquidity, or adverse trends). Provide a brief explanation of your analysis, referencing my inputs and how they align with the conditions for selling ATM options (60+ days) or OTM options (7 days).
Recommend the Best Option-Selling Strategy: Clearly state whether I should sell:
At-the-money (ATM) options with 60+ days to expiration if conditions are ideal (e.g., stable markets, high IV, good liquidity).
Out-of-the-money (OTM) options with 7 days to expiration if conditions are less ideal or worst (e.g., high uncertainty, low IV, or poor liquidity). Include a brief justification for your recommendation, tying it to the market conditions and my inputs.
Optional Clarification: If my answers are incomplete or unclear, ask follow-up questions to clarify before making the recommendation. If no data is available for a specific indicator, make a reasonable assumption and note it in your analysis.
Output Format: Present your recommendation in a clear, structured format:
Market Condition Assessment: [Summary of market conditions based on my inputs]
Recommended Strategy: [ATM with 60+ days or OTM with 7 days]
Justification: [Why this strategy fits the market conditions]
Additional Notes: [Any assumptions made or suggestions for further analysis]

#3 Trade / Portfolio Analysis Prompt

Please begin by asking me the 5 questions about market indicators to start the analysis.

I am an options trader seeking to optimize my portfolio’s options strategy for a specific stock, [STOCK_NAME], based on current market conditions and my portfolio’s cash position. Your task is to analyze my portfolio’s current trades, assess market conditions by asking targeted questions, evaluate the cash position, and recommend adjustments to my options strategy to align with market risk levels. In healthy markets, I prefer to maintain a low cash position (e.g., <20% of portfolio) and sell aggressive options (e.g., at-the-money [ATM] options with 60+ days to expiration). In high-risk markets, I prefer to hold a higher cash position (e.g., >40% of portfolio) and sell less risky options (e.g., out-of-the-money [OTM] options with 7 days to expiration). Follow these steps and present the results in a clear, structured format, using recent data or reasonable assumptions (noted explicitly) if specific portfolio details are incomplete.
Request Portfolio Details:
Ask me to provide the following details about my portfolio and [STOCK_NAME]:
Current cash position (as a percentage of total portfolio value or dollar amount).
Current options positions for [STOCK_NAME] (e.g., type [call/put], strike price, expiration date, ATM/OTM/ITM, premium received, and quantity).
Other major holdings (e.g., stocks, ETFs, or other options) and their approximate allocation (as a percentage of the portfolio).
Total portfolio value (optional, to contextualize cash position).
If I don’t provide sufficient details, make reasonable assumptions (e.g., assume a diversified portfolio with 50% equities, 10% options, 40% cash) and note them clearly.
Ask Questions About Market Conditions:
Ask me up to 5 concise, relevant questions to assess current market conditions, focusing on indicators such as:
Market volatility (e.g., VIX level or recent volatility trends).
Overall market trend (e.g., bullish, bearish, or range-bound).
Implied volatility (IV) of [STOCK_NAME] relative to its historical volatility (HV).
Liquidity and trading volume of [STOCK_NAME]’s options.
Significant upcoming events (e.g., earnings, economic reports, or geopolitical developments).
Ensure questions are specific and allow for precise data or observations (e.g., “What is the current VIX level, or have you observed recent volatility spikes?”).
Analyze Market Conditions:
Based on my answers, classify the market as:
Healthy: Stable or bullish trends, low-to-moderate VIX (<20), high IV relative to HV, good liquidity, and minimal disruptive events.
High-Risk: High volatility (VIX >30), bearish or erratic trends, low liquidity, low IV relative to HV, or significant upcoming events.
Moderate: Conditions between healthy and high-risk (e.g., VIX 20-30, mixed trends).
Provide a brief explanation of the classification, referencing my inputs and relevant indicators.
Evaluate Portfolio Cash Position:
Assess the current cash position relative to my preferences:
Healthy markets: Target <20% cash.
High-risk markets: Target >40% cash.
Moderate markets: Target 20-40% cash.
Calculate the cash position as a percentage of the total portfolio (if total value is provided) or use my input.
Highlight whether the current cash position aligns with the market condition or requires adjustment (e.g., reduce cash by investing or increase cash by closing positions).
Analyze Current Options Positions for [STOCK_NAME]:
Review the provided options positions for [STOCK_NAME], focusing on:
Aggressiveness (e.g., ATM vs. OTM, time to expiration).
Risk exposure (e.g., delta, premium decay, potential loss/gain).
Alignment with market conditions (e.g., aggressive ATM options in healthy markets, conservative OTM options in high-risk markets).
Calculate the portfolio’s delta exposure for [STOCK_NAME]’s options (e.g., sum of delta × 100 × number of contracts) to estimate market sensitivity.
Note any misalignments (e.g., aggressive options in a high-risk market).
Recommend Options Strategy Adjustments:
Based on the market condition, cash position, and current options for [STOCK_NAME], recommend one of the following strategies:
Healthy Market: Sell ATM options with 60+ days to expiration to maximize premium income, reduce cash position to <20% by deploying capital.
High-Risk Market: Sell OTM options with 7 days to expiration to minimize risk, increase cash position to >40% by closing aggressive positions or holding cash.
Moderate Market: Sell slightly OTM options with 30-60 days to expiration, maintain 20-40% cash position. அ - Provide specific recommendations for [STOCK_NAME], including:
Type of option (call/put), strike price, expiration date, and expected premium.
Number of contracts to sell (based on portfolio size and risk tolerance, if provided).
Actions to adjust existing positions (e.g., close, roll, or hold).
Justify the recommendation by linking to market conditions, cash position, and portfolio risk exposure.
Cash Position Adjustment:
Recommend specific actions to align the cash position with market conditions:
If cash is too high: Suggest deploying cash into new options positions or other investments (e.g., ETFs, stocks) to reduce cash to target levels.
If cash is too low: Suggest closing options positions or selling assets to increase cash reserves.
Estimate the dollar amount to adjust (if portfolio value is provided) and prioritize low-risk actions in high-risk markets.
Output Format:
Present the analysis and recommendations in a structured format:
Portfolio Overview: Summary of cash position, options positions for [STOCK_NAME], and other holdings.
Market Condition Assessment: Classification (healthy, high-risk, moderate) and explanation.
Cash Position Analysis: Current vs. target cash percentage and recommended adjustments.
Options Strategy Analysis: Evaluation of current positions and their alignment with market conditions.
Recommended Options Strategy: Specific options to sell (type, strike, expiration, quantity) and justification.
Cash Adjustment Actions: Steps to adjust cash position (e.g., sell assets, open/close positions).
Risks and Notes: Key risks (e.g., time decay, volatility spikes) and any assumptions made.
Include a table summarizing:
Current options positions (type, strike, expiration, premium, delta).
Recommended new positions (type, strike, expiration, estimated premium).
Cash position (current vs. target percentage, adjustment amount).
Additional Notes:
If I provide incomplete data, use reasonable assumptions (e.g., VIX = 20, moderate liquidity, no major events) and note them clearly.
Highlight risks associated with the recommended strategy (e.g., potential losses in volatile markets, time decay for short-term options).
If needed, suggest monitoring tools (e.g., portfolio trackers like Yahoo Finance or thinkorswim) to track positions and market conditions.
Please begin by asking me for the portfolio details (cash position, options positions for [STOCK_NAME], other holdings, total portfolio value) and the 5 questions about market conditions to start the analysis.
