Playing Stacked Squeezes

It was an explosive start to the week, highlighted by AAPL joining the 10x club as I played the tech giant’s post-earnings rally to a 1,000%+ win.* 


Welcome to the 10x club, AAPL!

This monster win came from playing the surprise earnings gap in AAPL, a strategy that’s paid off handsomely in the past. At the same time, there were plenty of attractive TPS setups over various time frames, as well. 

By following the TPS strategy, there will be times when I find a stock that has TTM Squeezes forming on multiple time frames. This will often occur when I’m playing a daily chart and the shares continue to consolidate into a nice high-and-tight pattern. 

Let’s go over what I refer to as “stacked squeezes,” and discuss how I play these types of charts. 

Starting on the Daily

When I’m looking at a stock’s chart, I’ll almost always start on the daily time frame to get a good feel for the shares’ broader price action. Sometimes the daily chart will look decent, but it takes further investigation, in the form of narrowing the view down to the 195-minute or 1-hour charts, before a better TPS picture begins to materialize. 

Other times, the daily chart itself is the TPS play. However, playing a daily chart usually means taking a more “long-term” approach compared to other LottoX-style trades that I open and close in just a day or two. Generally, if I’m trading a stock’s daily chart, it means I’m willing to hold it for at least a couple days. 

If I do trade a stock’s daily chart, I’ll be periodically checking in to make sure my setup is holding. If the shares move against me, the TTM Squeeze breaks lower, and the shares move below the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) or another important level, I may decide to exit my position. 

On the other hand, if the shares hold the setup and consolidate on a daily chart, it could present an opportunity to play more short-term trades on the same stock. 

Spotting Stacked Squeezes

We can think of this as the daily chart leading us to short-term opportunities. The key is not just sitting on the daily chart you were originally playing, but checking out the stock on smaller time frames as well -- even the 30-minute and 15-minute charts when there’s considerable consolidation.

If I start a position using a stock’s TPS setup on a daily chart, and then notice more squeezes forming on smaller time frames, I’ll add to my position. Finding these stacked squeezes is a great opportunity to get behind a stock before a big move.

Multiple squeezes on the same stock says that there’s an increased chance for an outsized move in the near term, and by playing different time frames, potentially with shorter-term option contracts, it gives us more ways to make money off the stock’s move.

This is also a case where playing the same stock cuts down on time scanning the market for more opportunities. If you know me, you know I’ll trade the same stock over and over again, if it keeps giving me strong setups. 

Learning From RH

A good example of this is RH’s chart in recent weeks. RH has been a familiar name on my weekly watchlists, as I originally began tracking its daily chart a few weeks back. You can see the TTM Squeeze that was in place in early July, and how the shares broke out nicely to new highs. 


RH’s daily chart

But while it was the daily chart that originally attracted me to RH, other squeezes began to form on smaller time frames by mid-July. Look at the squeeze on the 195-minute chart from this time. 


RH July squeezes on 195-minute chart

In fact, on July 10, RH was sporting squeezes on the 1-hour and 30-minute charts, as well! The signs were increasingly pointing to an upside move in RH, indicating a great time to get behind the stock. 

And it was a classic high-and-tight pattern, as the shares consolidated nicely near fresh highs. High-and-tight patterns are a great indication to check for squeezes on smaller time frames, if you haven’t yet.  

Overall, it can pay to watch for stacked squeezes. Don’t get stuck on your original chart time frame, and don’t ditch a position just because the stock’s consolidating… that may actually be a sign to add more. 

Instead, start with the daily chart as an anchor of sorts, and feel free to “trade around it” on shorter time frames in the meantime. This will give you more ways to profit from the same stock and stick to only the very best chart setups. 

Alright, gang, I’ll leave it there for now. Hopefully many of you have been able to hit on some lotto plays recently. If not, keep working, and make sure to check out my live training sessions this Wednesday. Keep an eye on your inbox for more information. 

I’ll talk to you all soon. Stay safe.
