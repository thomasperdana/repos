Options Basics
If you do a quick “options trading” search, you’ll get the technical definition of options which, quite frankly, confused the hell out of me when I was first learning. 
Google will tell you that there are two types of options -- calls and puts. Options contracts allow you to control a certain number of shares for a certain period of time. 
Buying a call gives you the right (but not the obligation) to buy 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (the strike price). 
Buying a put gives you the right (but not the obligation) to sell 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (the strike price). 
But I’ll let you in on a little secret here… few traders that I know use call or put options to actually buy or sell the shares. 
It took me a long time to understand that in the beginning!
Options contracts can be traded (bought and sold) and used to speculate on a stocks direction JUST like trading shares of stock. 
Point blank… Options allow the LEVERAGE necessary to massively boost your returns -- and speculate on stocks you normally couldn’t afford to trade -- without putting a massive amount of capital on the line. 
Let’s go through a quick example.
Let’s say you were bullish on the ENTIRELY MADE UP Bear Enterprises (BEAR), the shares of which are priced around $150. 
To buy 100 shares outright would cost you a grand total of $15,000.
However, if you bought the 150-strike call option going two weeks out -- which is essentially a bet that BEAR shares will move beyond $150 by options expiration in two weeks -- it would cost you just $1.05. 
Buying one contract would cost you just $105 ($1.05 x 100, since each option allows you to control 100 shares). 
See what I mean?
Now, let’s say that next week, BEAR stock jumps to $160.
Had you bought stock for $15,000, your investment would now be worth $16,000 -- you’re up $1,000, or about 7%. 
Essentially, you risked 15,000 to make $1,000.
Not too shabby. But...
Had you bought the 150-strike call, it would now have a whopping $10 in intrinsic value alone. That’s a return of MORE THAN 850% from your initial $105 investment! 
With the option you bought, you risked $105 to make a whopping $892! 
Now I know I’ve got your attention...
So let’s go through the opposite scenario. Let’s say BEAR stock dropped to $140.
The shares you bought for $15,000 would be worth $14,000, representing a $1,000 loss.
Meanwhile, you’d be on pace to lose the entire cost of the call option you bought, but that’s a relatively slim $105. 
With options, your risk is fixed and your upside potential is, well… Infinite.
From what I just layed out for you, options are perfect for…
	•	Small Accounts
	•	Using leverage to rake in outsized gains from SMALL stock moves
	•	Traders who want to define their risk, and maximize their upside profit potential
Additionally, here are some additional terms you might need to know when understanding how to trade options.
Limit Order - An order that will only be executed if contracts are available at your specific limit price or better. You can set the limit price that you want the contracts to be executed at. 
Market Order - An order to buy or sell that’s executed immediately at the current market prices. 
Stop Loss - An order placed with a broker to buy or sell a specific options contract once the options contract reaches a certain price. With options, typically the stop loss order is executed on the bid price, or the ask price. 
Buy to Open (BTO) - Used to establish a long or short position in an underlying security. Used to purchase a call or put option. 
Buy to Close (BTC) - Used to close out an existing option trade. Used to exit a short position on a call or put option. 
Sell to Open (STO) - Used to open an options trade by selling or establishing a short position in an option. Used to receive the premium on the option from the purchaser of the option. 
Sell to Close (STC) - Used to close out an existing option trade. Used to exit a long position on a call or put option.
