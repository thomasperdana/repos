My “10x” System
The system behind my 10X TRADES!
This system works a little bit differently than my LottoX system, but same idea! Cheap trades, short hold times, and of course… Unparalleled profit potential. 
With my LottoX trades, opportunity is everywhere. But with my 10x trades, the conditions in which these opportunities pop up are specific and rare. 
First thing you need to know, is that I use the volatility of earnings season to make these kinds of trades.
When identifying perfect opportunities for 10x trades, here are the specific conditions I’m looking for:
	•	Stocks near All Time Highs
	•	Earnings beat : 2x the “Expected Move”
	•	High Short Float > 15%
Let me explain a bit further about what I mean by “expected move” and “high short float”.
Expected move - is the price range that investors are expecting the stock to trade between as a result of the earnings report. For example, investors might be expecting an earnings hit or miss to affect the stock price by 5% so they “expect” a move of about 5% either up or down, since nobody knows whether it will be an earnings beat, or an earnings miss. If the earnings beat is greater than what the market makers were pricing in, that would result in a higher than expected earnings beat. So if market makers were pricing in a 5% earnings move, I’m looking for a 10% or higher earnings surprise. 
High Short Float - occurs when there is a high percentage of investors who are shorting the stock, versus investors who are long the stock. This means that there is a high percentage of investors who believe the share price is going to drop. A high short float > 15% implies that 15% of the shares that are currently being traded, are held short by investors. This is integral in making this system work because you can see this as a two-fold process. If the company reported earnings that resulted in 2x the expected move, you will see two things occur. The first, is that bullish investors who want to buy the stock will start flooding in. The second, is that investors who shorted the stock now have to cover the shorts by purchasing the stocks. This will result in a huge volume of purchase orders for the stock, which has a high probability of driving the stock upwards at an alarming rate. 
With that being said, If I see these 3 criteria are met, I’m taking my shot.
Here’s an example of what my 10x setup looks like :

Here we have TWLO. Great stock and what do we see?
✅ NEAR ALL TIME HIGHS
✅ MOVE VS. EXP MOVE: 3X EXPECTED MOVE
✅ SHORT FLOAT: 32%
TWLO beat earnings the night before by 3x the expected move
All my criteria was met, and I knew before the market even opened, that this was a potential 10x trade.
I never know how long I plan on holding these trades, but they vary from 30 minutes, to holding until the next day. However, one rule I always follow is that I scale out of my trades. What I mean by this is that when I start to see profits that I’m willing to take, I sell portions of my trade. That way I can pay myself along the way, make back the initial investment, and still have the remaining portion of my trade to ride the wave higher. 
I took this trade at market open and within an hour I was already up 1000%. I sold some of my positions, and held the rest to reach even higher at 1400%! These are the setups that I look for and again I always scale out of my trades to make sure I’m being paid every step of the way. 
One very important thing to remember : I NEVER HOLD THROUGH EARNINGS - these plays come to fruition AFTER an earnings beat. 

During earnings season be sure to be on the lookout for alerts on these 10x trades. I will be informing members about which plays I am thinking about, so be sure to check your inbox daily! 
Note :
	•	I have NO IDEA if these trades will work or not, it's just my setup for 1,000% winners.
	•	Because of this, position sizing is key. Don't risk more than you are willing to lose. I put 1%-2% of my account into these trades. 
	•	These trades are very volatile and can move very quickly, don't wait for my entry or my exit, you’ll know my exact plan in my morning emails before I even take the trade. Remember, though, you’ll be able to see all my positions in my live streams.
