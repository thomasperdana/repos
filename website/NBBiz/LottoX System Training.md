LottoX Exclusive Training
1)   What is “LottoX”?
Just what it sounds like, a lottery ticket.  These are ‘fun’ trades (when they work) because we’re trying to time a move in a stock with short dated options, typically that expire the same week or sometimes the same day.  The idea here is that you don’t risk a lot of capital, but go for very high % gains. 
 I look for a stock that is TRENDING up, then I look for my PATTERN, pullback and sideways consolidation under that high.  And finally, I look for the LOTTOX INDICATOR setting up in that consolidation period, that will allow me to make an entry in my buy zone.  Basically I’m looking for strong stocks which are consolidating, and I must have RED DOTS in the LottoX indicator. If these things line up, I can take a trade.

2)   What is my LottoX Indicator (TTM Squeeze)?  
LottoX is an indicator on a chart that displays red dots when a stock is “resting” and can indicate a larger move coming in one direction of the other.  Using the LottoX indicator, I try and take a position in that stock during the ‘rest’ period, and hopefully catch the larger move up or down.

3)What time frames do you use?
LottoX trades are generally based on a smaller time frame chart (130 minutes and smaller), but, the bigger the timefreame, the bigger the move.  Also, this method works best in stocks that have volume, not thin illiquid names. I sometimes even go as far down to a 5 or 10 min chart for a short day trade. My standard timeframes are:  130m, 78m, 1h, 30m, 15m, 10m and 5m.
 
4) What are the 8 and 21 ema lines?
These are the only moving averages I really use.  I think of these as the ‘mean’, and stocks always move away from, then come back to, the mean.
 

5) What is VWAP?
Volume weighted average price.  I use VWAP to daytrade against. In a bullish setup, I want to be a buyer on a pullback to the VWAP.  In a bearish setup, I want to be a seller on move up into VWAP. I use VWAP on smaller time frame charts for daytrading.  I don’t really use VWAP when considering swing trades against larger time frame charts.

6)What are the Bollinger Bands?
I use the Bollinger Bands as a great entry point, a great area to make a bet against, either long or short, with  defined risk on a close outside the Bollinger Band. This strategy works on all time frames, but works better I’ve found on daily charts.  For example, a strong, trending stock will rarely test it’s lower Bollinger Band on the daily chart. But if/when it does, it’s typically a perfect buying opportunity.

7)Where is your “Buy Zone”, and where will you Stop-Out?
Typically my buy zone is between the 8ema and the 21ema on the time frame chart I’m playing.  So if I’m playing a chart to the long side, I want to be a buyer when the stock price is below it’s 8ema and above it’s 21ema.  In a more volatile market, I’m even more conservative with my buy zone and repositioning it to between the 21ema and the lower Bollinger Band.  Typically my stop will be a close below the lower Bollinger Band, or if the squeeze that I’m playing fires against me.
 
8)What is your Profit Target? (see fib extensions)
In most cases, the profit target is always the 127.2% extension of the high to low move of the price action within the time frame i’m playing.  There are exceptions and it will always depend on the setup, but my typical setup, I use Fibonacci Extension targets. 
 10) What Strike and Expiration do you usually buy for your TPS system?   
For smaller time frame charts, I go anywhere between a few days to a week out. The general rule of thumb is this: when in doubt, go further out.  There is really no downside, other than paying a little more for the option, to give yourself more time in the trade. The more you get into the habit of going further out in time, the easier you will find options trading.
 
11) What Delta do you look for?
I try and shoot for options that are somewhere between delta 50 and delta 70.  There are always exceptions, like lotto trades, or trades where we’re positionion for a run into earnings.  But typically, regardless of the time frame that I’m playing, I’ll go for the delta 50 to delta 70 options.
 
12)What is Theta decay?
Theta decay is a measure of the rate of decline in the value of an option as it approaches expiration.  The further dated option will decay slower than a short dated option. This is particularly relevant to my LOTTO trades as they decay quickly and we need to be ‘right’ very quickly.  
 
13)  What is “Short Float”, and why do you like stocks that have it?
Short Float is the number of shares that are held short as a percentage of the total shares being held. The higher the short float (15-20% and above), the faster a stock may move up as those shorts cover when it does move (covering shorts = buying).  So taking a position in on a bullish stock, that also has high short float, increases the odds that it will take off quickly.
 
14)  How do you scan for stocks with the LottoX setup?
There are a variety of tools you can use to scan for LottoX setups.  I like to use Finviz which is a free stock scanning tool. Many brokers have scanning tools built into their platforms you can also use. No matter what scanner you use,  I’m scanning for the following criteria: Stocks baove $30, Average Volume above 100,000, 0-10% below 52 week high, and then looking for LottoX indicators on the smaller time frame charts.

INTERNAL INDICATORS
1)What are the TICK’s?
The TICK’s are a real time indication of buying and selling across the market.  TICK’s above +600 indicate strong buying and below -600 indicates strong selling.  Readings between these levels are just ‘noise’.
https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/market-internals
2)What is the $ADD indicator?
The Advance/Decline indicator measures the net advancing stocks vs. declining stocks on the NYSE. It is measured as number of advancing stocks - number of declining stocks.  I look for this indicator to be rising, showing a favorable market for long calls.
https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/market-internals
3) What is the VIX or VXX?
This Volatility Index show the “fear” level of the market and institutional buyers in particular.  I look for this indicator to be trending down showing a favorable market for long calls, If it’s trending higher, this means that people are paying more for out of the money puts, ie hedging longs, and this is a bearish reading when this is happening.  
https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/market-internals
4)What is the $PCALL?
The Putt/Call Ratio indicator measures the amount of Put activity relative to Calls volume currently in the market.   I watch this indicator during a market decline. If the number gets above 1.0 that means the market is heavy on Puts and we could see a short squeeze rally. However, if the market is falling sharply and the put call is say .85, I have no interest in buying as that would indicate that the majority is still buying the dip, I don’t want to trade with the crowd but rather wait for the reading to get extreme, then take the opposite side of the trade.

 5) How do you use these Internal Market Indicators to make trading decisions?
I use a combination of these Market Internals to make buy and sell decisions intraday.  They are a very powerful tools if you know how to use them. They tell me what is happening ‘behind the scenes’ rather than just using price action, I can have a hint into what the money is actually doing, and, what it may do next.

FIBONACCI EXTENSION (Profit Targets) and SYMMETRY
1)What is a Fibonacci Extension?
Fibonacci extensions are very powerful mathematical targets, measured off a recent pullback in a stock.  I like to take a position in the stock on a pullback with the LottoX red dots, and take profits at the 127.2% extension of that pullback.  See the following video for examples of how I use this tool.  https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/fibonacci-trading-lesson-1 
https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/lesson-3-intro-to-fibonacci 
2) What do you mean when you say the “the 1272” or “the 1618” profit targets?
These are quick abbreviations for my primary and secondary profit targets on most of my trades.  Using a Fib Extension tool, I will set my primary profit target at 127.2% (127) extension. If i feel like the stock has more run room, I may leave a small portion of the trade on to the 161.8% (161) extension.  https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/fibonacci-trading-lesson-1 
4)What is Symmetry and how do you measure it?
Symmetry is another Fibonacci tool that helps measure the size of a recent pullback or run-up, and compare it to the current pullback or run-up.  The market tends to move in predictable patterns, so this allows me to take bets off similar levels … with a stop just below or above that level. The market might at first seem really random, but if you start actually measuring moves and comparing them to one another, you will see that the market, at times, is actually quite predictable.

5) What the name of the Fibonacci book you recommend?
 Fibonacci Trading: How to Master the Time and Price Advantage:  https://www.amazon.com/Fibonacci-Trading-Master-Price-Advantage/dp/007149815X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=SC7YKAH2BXDA&keywords=fibonacci&qid=1559885227&s=gateway&sprefix=fibonacci%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1 
TOS (thinkorswim) SETUP
1)Can i have a link to your TOS trading grid?
http://tos.mx/JHhdTi
2) Can i have a link to your TOS Master Watchlist?  
http://tos.mx/CHujYy
3) How do I set up the LottoX Indicators column in my watchlist?
Unfortunately you have to build this manually through thinkorswim script, and can’t just import the functionality.
Here is a video tutorial on how to build that:  https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/june-22nd-2018-ttm-squeeze-watchlist-tutorial 
Additionally here is the NEW script code to use:  http://tos.mx/Hi2bZz    https://tos.mx/NmQRcn
4) Do you have a video on how to set up the LottoX Indicator, Bollinger Bands, and 8,21,200 ema’s on my charts?
Luckily if you use thinkorswim (TOS), you can import my trading grid and all the settings are already built for you.  If you’re using another broker, you’ll have to search how to set those up in your specific broker. Also, you can Google how to do just about anything in Thinkorswim and find videos on YouTube that explain everything.  
The link to my trading grid in TOS is here:  http://tos.mx/JHhdTi
5)Do I need thinkorswim (TOS) to trade your setups?
No, you can trade my TPS system from any broker that allows Level 1 option trading (buying and selling of Calls and Puts).  You will also need a way to view the John Carter TTM Squeeze indicator, which is not offered on all platforms. Check your broker to see if they have it.  
Note:  I recommend opening an account with TD  Ameritrade. You can then access the active trading platform, Thinkorswim, for FREE.

MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS
1)Did you buy “x” … did you sell “X”?
If you don’t see a position in the Active Positions list in the upper left corner of my trading grid … then you can check the trading feed to see if I bought or sold that position during the day.  Generally if you don’t see it in the Active Positions list, I do not have it anymore.
2)Are you still in “X” butterfly trade?  
If you want to live a long life, don’t ask this question in chat ;)  Butterfly trades are a buy and forget type trade and I don’t post them in my main portfolio as the multiple option strikes clutter up the account feed.  We usually don’t monitor these trades closely, until they get near expiration.
3) What trading books do you recommend?
There are many great trading books, but the ones below are books that I’ve personally read and each has impacted my trading.
Trading in the Zone: https://www.amazon.com/Trading-Zone-Confidence-Discipline-Attitude/dp/0735201447 
Fibonacci Trading: How to Master the Time and Price Advantage:  https://www.amazon.com/Fibonacci-Trading-Master-Price-Advantage/dp/007149815X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=SC7YKAH2BXDA&keywords=fibonacci&qid=1559885227&s=gateway&sprefix=fibonacci%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1 
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator:

4) What is OP-EX week?
Option Expiration Week is the Monday through Friday that culminate in the expiration of all the Monthly Options.  This falls on the 3rd Friday of each month. The large cap stocks tend to move around alot, sucking out the premium, which tends to make OP-EX week choppy trading.
5) What does HOD and LOD mean?
These are simply abbreviations for “High of Day” and “Low of Day” when referring to a stock.
