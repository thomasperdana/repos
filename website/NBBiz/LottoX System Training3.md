LottoX System Training
My “TPS” Trading System
Trend… Pattern… Squeeze (My LottoX Indicator). That’s my seven figure options strategy summed up in 3 words.
I’ve invested time and money testing different trading strategies…and believe me, you could spend a lifetime and still not run through them all! 
However, I started to pick up on common themes after studying the traits of the best traders.
One strategy that I was drawn to, and still am to this day is trend trading.
It’s when you go with the flow. In other words, if a stock or ETF is trading higher, instead of fighting it,
I want to join in and try to ride the wave up.
Trading with trends is like swimming with the ocean current. It’s not just easier…it’s more predictable.
It took me a while to wrap my mind around the intricacies of trend trading.
I always seemed to identify them after the fact... I’d enter trades at the late stages of the trend and
never seem to make enough to justify the risk I was taking.
Man was that frustrating.
However, that was then, and this is now.




The ‘T’ in my TPS System stands for trend.
Here’s an example of a stock that’s trending:

Clear as day, right? Great! Let’s move on.



Every successful chartist I’ve ever come across has a favorite pattern they love to trade.
For me, it puts the ‘P’ in my TPS setup.
However, like a piece of abstract art, show two traders a chart, and they’re likely to tell you about two different patterns they see. 
What can I say, charting is both an art and science. 
For years I struggled with accepting that.
The pattern that I look for is simple. It’s a pattern of consolidation, or a continuation pattern.
Consolidation can be thought of as areas of ‘rest’ within a chart. Think about it like a sprinter who just gave his all in the 400 meter dash. Before he starts his next race, he’s going to need to take a breather, right? 
Stocks are the same way.










I’m looking for a stock that has sprinted upwards, and is resting (consolidation) for it’s next move higher (continuation). 
So let’s take a peek at what this consolidation pattern looks like:

MTCH: 60 Minute Chart
Do you see the flag pattern? That’s exactly what I look for.
The pole of the flag is the trend, and the coiling body of the flag indicates consolidation, where prices are moving sideways, resting for its next move. 
The consolidation period is where I strike.

But consolidation periods can last for minutes… Hours… Days… Even weeks. So how do we know when to get in?
The “Squeeze” That brings me to the last step in my TPS system… The “Squeeze” - In other words, my LottoX Indicator. 
The squeeze was one of the most significant discoveries of my career. It turned me from a breakeven trader into a consistently profitable one because it allowed me to master TIMING. 
It identifies when a stock is building up energy through price consolidation. As the trading range narrows, the closer the stock gets to releasing it’s coiled up energy and making an explosive move. 
Pairing this with options leverages my capital and increases my earnings potential. It’s the very key that helped me turn $38,000 into over $2,000,000 in two years. 
The squeeze is a simple indicator that is easily identifiable.











Check out that same chart from above, with the squeeze indicator visible:

MTCH: 60 Minute Chart
The red dots at the bottom represent what I call a “squeeze” and they indicate that the stock is in consolidation mode, and energy is building up... 
The red dots say to me, “Hey Nate, I'm getting ready to make a move here. Get in right now or you’re going to miss it!” 
What we’re looking for is for prices to explode out of the trading range as it’s built up energy is released. This is what I call it when a squeeze “fires”. 
See what happens to MTCH stock when the squeeze fired? It rocketed out of its consolidation pattern and soared more than 8% in a single day! 
The key I found with the squeeze is putting it together with other trading signals. For me, that includes a strong uptrend and a consolidation pattern - hence my TPS setup. I want to enter a trade where all three of these elements are present. Then, I wait for the squeeze to fire. 
Most of the time I will play the long side of stocks. That means I look for bullish stocks near their highs that look ready to continue higher. 
So there you go… Trend, Pattern, Squeeze. It’s the backbone and foundation behind 99% of the trades that I take, and is quite literally, my million dollar system. 
The trick to becoming a successful trader is combining multiple signals that include timing, price levels, and chart trends. Once you learn these, you’ve got a winning ticket. 
Now that you have the system down, I’m sure you might be wondering, “Nate, HOW do you find the perfect candidates to trade?” 
Let’s move on to the next step.
Identifying the perfect candidates to trade
The next step is to actually find the perfect candidates to trade!
Every trader I know starts their day with some version of a stock screener. They look for stocks moving in the premarket, tickers that meet their preferred setups, or review companies they like to trade over and over. 
I personally look at all of these, but today we’re going to focus on how I screen for stocks to trade. The keys to a good stock scan include: 
	•	Looking for stocks that meet your trading style
	•	Finding setups before they have a chance to play out
	•	Selecting stocks with enough liquidity so you can easily enter and exit the trades
Now that you have a solid understanding of my system, let’s dive into the scan that I use on a regular basis to find the perfect candidates to trade. 

You’ll be happy to know that I don’t use any expensive fancy shmancy screening platform; just good ole’ Finviz.com. Completely free and does the trick! 
Once you click “Screener” in the upper left hand corner, it brings you to a page that allows you to screen for hundreds of different criteria. 
My scanning criteria is pretty simple, and it’s as follows: 
	•	Within 10% of 52 week high
	•	Price over $30
	•	Averale daily volume over 100k
	•	High short interest (Over 20%)
Here’s what those inputs look like on the Finviz screener:




This spits me out a list of stocks that are strong, trading near or at their all time highs, have enough volume to be traded, priced over $30, and have a high short float (hopefully forcing a short squeeze). 
These are what I have found to be the best criteria for screening for stocks that fit my TPS setup.
From there, I start going through all of the names that this screen spits out and looking at each chart.
The good thing is that this scan usually spits out about 10-15 names.
It takes me about 5 seconds to identify if a chart is one that meets my TPS setup, or one that doesn't. It might take you a bit longer… And that’s okay! You’ll get there. 
What I’m looking for is a consolidation pattern below a recent high, and then I check to see if it has a “squeeze” on one of my favorite time frame charts (60 minute, 78 minute, 130 minute,195 minute, and Daily). 
If I find a chart that looks playable and a stock that meets all of that criteria, I likely have a possible trade on my hands. 










Here’s a picture perfect example of the setup I’m looking for:

SWKS: Daily Chart
At the time of the bull flag pattern, SWKS was consolidating right under all time highs after making a huge move to the upside. 
Trend… Check. Pattern… Check.
We also have the final piece of the puzzle which is the “Squeeze” represented by those red dots at the bottom of the chart. 
I now have everything that I would need to take a trade based on my TPS setup.
After the squeeze fired, SWKS exploded out of it’s bull flag, rocketing from 95 to over 122 in less than 3 weeks. 
(Pro tip: I LOVE stocks at all time highs… When they break out, there’s no overhead resistance stopping them.) 
Are you beginning to understand the power of TPS?
Trading requires you to bring together a lot of different ideas at once. It becomes like a golf swing...many moving parts...but you need to be able to work without analysis paralysis. 
It took me a long time to get to that point. But just like golf… The more you do it, the better you get.
Eventually, maybe you’ll get better than me at finding these opportunities!
