When I’ll Trade Stock Over Options

As I’ve said in previous emails, I’m going to try and focus my weekly live training sessions on specific topics going forward. This past week I covered vertical spreads, so check out that live training if you weren’t able to attend. 


Don’t miss my vertical spread lesson

If you’re an experienced options trader, utilizing spreads can be a good strategy to add to your trading arsenal to take advantage of different types of setups and market environments. 

At the same time, I know that there are a lot of people who don’t feel as comfortable with trading options. With that in mind, I wanted to talk a bit about situations where it may make sense to trade stock versus options, and when I’m most likely to do it myself. 

Why I Use Options For TPS Trades

As you guys know, my general approach, especially in LottoX, is to find the best TPS setups to trade, and then pick up short-term options that have the chance to gain 100% or more. 

One reason LottoX is centered around options trading and not stock trading is because trading options allows me to hit those 100% winners on a relatively small move in the stock. Sometimes just a 1% move in a stock can result in a significant rise in the value of its options. 

This is, of course, because of the leverage that options provide, since most options contracts derive their value from 100 shares of the underlying stock. Because of that, I’m able to put up a relatively small amount of money, but give myself the opportunity for a huge payday. 

So leverage is the key, gang. For someone like me who trades on a small account, trading options is really the only way to substantially increase the size of my account. However, if I did have a large account, I would trade much more stock. That’s because trading stock is simpler than trading options. 

Avoiding Time Decay By Trading Stock

Why is trading stock simpler than trading options? First of all, there’s no expiration date when you simply buy shares, and that means no theta, otherwise known as time decay. As a refresher, this refers to when your option contract loses value as it approaches expiration, even though the underlying stock hasn’t moved against you. 

Theta is one of the “greeks” that measure the different factors that affect the price of an option. The other greek you’ll often hear discussed is “delta,” which I actually covered in a recent video update, if you skip to about the 11:30 mark. 


I do my morning updates just for you, gang.

The main idea to know with theta, though, is that an option’s value can decrease dramatically as it moves closer to expiration -- so not only do you need to get the direction right when trading options, but you also need the directional move to happen fast enough to offset the time decay. 

When trading stock, however, you don’t need to be perfect with the timing. If the move you’re targeting takes longer than expected, it’s no sweat. You can stay patient and wait for it to develop, without watching the value of your position diminish. 

When the Price Ain’t Right with Options

Another reason I may sometimes trade stock versus options is because the options are simply too expensive or the bid/ask spread is too wide. This is often the case on high-priced stocks like pre-split Tesla (TSLA) or Amazon (AMZN). 

If premiums are jacked up on a stock’s options, that means I need an even bigger move to offset what I pay up front, and that can make it difficult to land profitable trades. Of course, using spread trades is another way to combat high-priced options. 

As for the bid/ask spreads, this is referring to the situations when there’s a wide gap between what you’d have to pay for an option (ask price) versus the amount you could expect to receive if you sold it immediately (bid price). 

In other words, if the bid/ask spread is wide, it can create what’s known as “slippage,” which is when your option contract immediately loses value once you buy it. 

One name that often has wide bid/ask spreads is Chipotle (CMG). You can see below how the at-the-money $1240 call has an ask of $27 and a bid of $22.60, meaning there’s a $4.40 gap between what you’d pay to buy it and what you could theoretically expect to immediately sell it for.

Low-liquidity Stocks 

One reason some stocks don’t have reasonable option prices is because they don’t see a lot of options trading volume and there’s less liquidity around their options. If there aren’t enough potential buyers for your option contract, it can make it difficult to exit a trade at your desired price. 

For a popular stock like Apple (AAPL), for example, there likely won’t be much of an issue getting in and out of trades at desired prices… that’s why fellowRagingBull trader Kyle Dennis loves to trade AAPL options.

However, if you’re targeting a small-cap stock, there’s a good chance the spreads are pretty ugly, since there aren’t many people trading its options. But what’s interesting about small caps is that a lot of times it’s not even necessary to use options to hit big winners, since lower-priced stocks are capable of making outsized percentage moves on their own. 

I don’t trade small-cap stocks often, but when I do I’ll usually just buy the shares. You can read about one of my penny stock trades from earlier this year to see how I approach these situations. 

The Final Consideration

Aside from not necessarily getting the leverage that options provide, there is one more downfall to trading stock, and that’s the more loosely defined risk. 

As I said earlier, I could just as well use stock to trade TPS setups if I had a bigger account, because even just a 5% move on a $100,000 position is a pretty sweet payday. 

However, what if I put up that much cash and there was unexpected news that sent the shares spiraling 30%? That certainly wouldn’t be as sweet. And of course in other cases, stocks can sell off by much more than that, which could be extremely painful if you have a large position in place. 

When buying options, however, you always know that your risk is defined to the initial premium paid. So when I buy to open a $1,000 call option position, I know that’s the most I can lose no matter what happens to the stock. Whereas that imaginary $100,000 stock trade I mentioned could lose a ton more than that if the stock crashes. 

In Summary…

As always, whatever route you take not only depends on the specific situation, but on your own trading style and risk tolerance, as well. It’s absolutely possible to use my TPS approach with trading stock instead of options; you’re just giving up the chance for leveraged gains in the process.

 I feel as though I threw a lot at you here, so to sum up the main ideas…
