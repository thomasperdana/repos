NATHAN’S TPS STRATEGY FAQ
Nathan Bear on January 27, 2020 at 08:40 PM

1)   What is the “TPS” System?
This is my bread and butter system, and it makes up 80% of the trades I take.  TPS stands for Trend, Pattern Squeeze. I look for a stock that is TRENDING up, near recent or even 52 week highs,  Then I look for my PATTERN in that stock of new high, pullback and sideways consolidation under that high. And finally, I look for a TTM SQUEEZE setting up in that consolidation period, that will allow me to make an entry in my buy zone.  Basically I’m looking for strong stocks which are consolidating, and I must have RED DOTS in the squeeze indicator. If these things line up, I can take a trade.

2)   What is a Squeeze (TTM Squeeze)?  
A squeeze is an indicator on a chart that displays red dots when a stock is “resting” and can indicate a larger move coming in one direction of the other.  Using the TPS system, I try and take a position in that stock during a squeeze, during the ‘rest’ period, and hopefully catch the larger move up or down. https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/january-8th-2019-the-squeeze-tutorial-and-q-a

3)What time frames do you use?
The TPS System can be used on any time frame, but, the bigger the timefreame, the bigger the move.  Also, this method works best in stocks that have volume, not thin illiquid names. I typically us a daily or 195 minute chart for swing trades that take a few days … down to a 5 or 10 min chart for a short day trade. My standard timeframes are:  Weekly, Daily, 195m, 130m, 78m, 1h, 30m, 15m, 10m and 5m.

4) What are the 8 and 21 ema lines?
These are the only moving averages I really use.  I think of these as the ‘mean’, and stocks always move away from, then come back to, the mean.

5) What is VWAP?
Volume weighted average price.  I use VWAP to daytrade against. In a bullish setup, I want to be a buyer on a pullback to the VWAP.  In a bearish setup, I want to be a seller on move up into VWAP. I use VWAP on smaller time frame charts for daytrading.  I don’t really use VWAP when considering swing trades against larger time frame charts.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp

6)What are the Bollinger Bands?
I use the Bollinger Bands as a great entry point, a great area to make a bet against, either long or short, with  defined risk on a close outside the Bollinger Band. This strategy works on all time frames, but works better I’ve found on daily charts.  For example, a strong, trending stock will rarely test it’s lower Bollinger Band on the daily chart. But if/when it does, it’s typically a perfect buying opportunity.
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp

7)Where is your “Buy Zone”, and where will you Stop-Out?
Typically my buy zone is between the 8ema and the 21ema on the time frame chart I’m playing.  So if I’m playing a daily chart to the long side, I want to be a buyer when the stock price is below it’s 8ema and above it’s 21ema.  In a more volatile market, I’m even more conservative with my buy zone and repositioning it to between the 21ema and the lower Bollinger Band.  Typically my stop will be a close below the lower Bollinger Band, or if the squeeze that I’m playing fires against me. 

8)What is your Profit Target? (see fib extensions)
In most cases, the profit target is always the 127.2% extension of the high to low move of the price action within the squeeze that I’m playing.  There are exceptions and it will always depend on the setup, but in the typical TPS setup, I use Fibonacci Extension targets. 

9)What is a LOTTO trade?
Just what it sounds like, a lottery ticket.  These are ‘fun’ trades (when they work) because we’re trying to time a move in a stock with short dated options, typically that expire the same week or sometimes the same day.  The idea here is that you don’t risk a lot of capital, but go for very high % gains. 

10) What Strike and Expiration do you usually buy for your TPS system?   
Typically I will go out a minimum of 30 days, or into the next monthly options expiration series, this is if I’m playing daily charts.  For smaller time frame charts, you can go out 2 weeks. The general rule of thumb is this: when in doubt, go further out. There is really no downside, other than paying a little more for the option, to give yourself more time in the trade.  The more you get into the habit of going further out in time, the easier you will find options trading.

11) What Delta do you look for?
I try and shoot for options that are somewhere between delta 50 and delta 70.  There are always exceptions, like lotto trades, or trades where we’re positionion for a run into earnings.  But typically, regardless of the time frame that I’m playing, I’ll go for the delta 50 to delta 70 options.

12)What is Theta decay?
Theta decay is a measure of the rate of decline in the value of an option as it approaches expiration.  The further dated option will decay slower than a short dated option. This is particularly relevant to my LOTTO trades as they decay quickly and we need to be ‘right’ very quickly.  

13)  What is “Short Float”, and why do you like stocks that have it?
Short Float is the number of shares that are held short as a percentage of the total shares being held. The higher the short float (15-20% and above), the faster a stock may move up as those shorts cover when it does move (covering shorts = buying).  So taking a position in on a bullish stock in a TPS setup, that also has high short float, increases the odds that it will take off quickly.

14)  How do you scan for stocks with the TPS setup?
There are a variety of tools you can use to scan for TPS setups.  I like to use Finviz which is a free stock scanning tool. Many brokers have scanning tools built into their platforms you can also use. No matter what scanner you use,  I’m scanning for the following criteria: Stocks baove $30, Average Volume above 100,000, 0-10% below 52 week high, and then looking for TTM Squeezes on the Daily or 195m charts.

INTERNAL INDICATORS

1)What are the TICK’s?
The TICK’s are a real time indication of buying and selling across the market.  TICK’s above +600 indicate strong buying and below -600 indicates strong selling.  Readings between these levels are just ‘noise’.
https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/market-internals

2)What is the $ADD indicator?
The Advance/Decline indicator measures the net advancing stocks vs. declining stocks on the NYSE. It is measured as number of advancing stocks - number of declining stocks.  I look for this indicator to be rising, showing a favorable market for long calls.
https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/market-internals

3) What is the VIX or VXX?
This Volatility Index show the “fear” level of the market and institutional buyers in particular.  I look for this indicator to be trending down showing a favorable market for long calls, If it’s trending higher, this means that people are paying more for out of the money puts, ie hedging longs, and this is a bearish reading when this is happening.  
https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/market-internals

4)What is the $PCALL?
The Putt/Call Ratio indicator measures the amount of Put activity relative to Calls volume currently in the market.   I watch this indicator during a market decline. If the number gets above 1.0 that means the market is heavy on Puts and we could see a short squeeze rally. However, if the market is falling sharply and the put call is say .85, I have no interest in buying as that would indicate that the majority is still buying the dip, I don’t want to trade with the crowd but rather wait for the reading to get extreme, then take the opposite side of the trade.  
https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/market-internals

5) How do you use these Internal Market Indicators to make trading decisions?
I use a combination of these Market Internals to make buy and sell decisions intraday.  They are a very powerful tools if you know how to use them. They tell me what is happening ‘behind the scenes’ rather than just using price action, I can have a hint into what the money is actually doing, and, what it may do next.

FIBONACCI EXTENSION (Profit Targets) and SYMMETRY

1)What is a Fibonacci Extension?
Fibonacci extensions are very powerful mathematical targets, measured off a recent pullback in a stock.  I like to take a position in the stock on a pullback with squeeze dots, and take profits at the 127.2% extension of that pullback.  See the following video for examples of how I use this tool. https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/fibonacci-trading-lesson-1https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/lesson-3-intro-to-fibonacci

2) What do you mean when you say the “the 1272” or “the 1618” profit targets?
These are quick abbreviations for my primary and secondary profit targets on most TPS trades.  Using a Fib Extension tool, I will set my primary profit target at 127.2% (127) extension. If i feel like the stock has more run room, I may leave a small portion of the trade on to the 161.8% (161) extension.  https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/fibonacci-trading-lesson-1

4)What is Symmetry and how do you measure it?
Symmetry is another Fibonacci tool that helps measure the size of a recent pullback or run-up, and compare it to the current pullback or run-up.  The market tends to move in predictable patterns, so this allows me to take bets off similar levels … with a stop just below or above that level. The market might at first seem really random, but if you start actually measuring moves and comparing them to one another, you will see that the market, at times, is actually quite predictable.

5) What the name of the Fibonacci book you recommend?

Fibonacci Trading: How to Master the Time and Price Advantage:  https://www.amazon.com/Fibonacci-Trading-Master-Price-Advantage/dp/007149815X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=SC7YKAH2BXDA&keywords=fibonacci&qid=1559885227&s=gateway&sprefix=fibonacci%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1

TOS (thinkorswim) SETUP

1)Can i have a link to your TOS trading grid?
http://tos.mx/JHhdTi

2) Can i have a link to your TOS Master Watchlist?  http://tos.mx/CHujYy

3) How do I set up the Squeeze Indicators column in my watchlist?
Unfortunately you have to build this manually through thinkorswim script, and can’t just import the functionality.
Here is a video tutorial on how to build that:  https://app.ragingbull.com/posts/june-22nd-2018-ttm-squeeze-watchlist-tutorial
Additionally here is the NEW script code to use:  http://tos.mx/Hi2bZz

4) Do you have a video on how to set up the TTM Squeeze, Bollinger Bands, and 8,21,200 ema’s on my charts?
Luckily if you use thinkorswim (TOS), you can import my trading grid and all the settings are already built for you.  If you’re using another broker, you’ll have to search how to set those up in your specific broker. Also, you can Google how to do just about anything in Thinkorswim and find videos on YouTube that explain everything.  
The link to my trading grid in TOS is here:  http://tos.mx/JHhdTi

5)Do I need thinkorswim (TOS) to trade your setups?
No, you can trade my TPS system from any broker that allows Level 1 option trading (buying and selling of Calls and Puts).  You will also need a way to view the John Carter TTM Squeeze indicator, which is not offered on all platforms. Check your broker to see if they have it.  
Note:  I recommend opening an account with TD  Ameritrade. You can then access the active trading platform, Thinkorswim, for FREE.

MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS

1)Did you buy “x” … did you sell “X”?
If you don’t see a position in the Active Positions list in the upper left corner of my trading grid … then you can check the trading feed to see if I bought or sold that position during the day.  Generally if you don’t see it in the Active Positions list, I do not have it anymore.

2)Are you still in “X” butterfly trade?  
If you want to live a long life, don’t ask this question in chat ;)  Butterfly trades are a buy and forget type trade and I don’t post them in my main portfolio as the multiple option strikes clutter up the account feed.  We usually don’t monitor these trades closely, until they get near expiration.

3) What trading books do you recommend?
There are many great trading books, but the ones below are books that I’ve personally read and each has impacted my trading.

4) What is OP-EX week?
Option Expiration Week is the Monday through Friday that culminate in the expiration of all the Monthly Options.  This falls on the 3rd Friday of each month. The large cap stocks tend to move around alot, sucking out the premium, which tends to make OP-EX week choppy trading.

5) What does HOD and LOD mean?
These are simply abbreviations for “High of Day” and “Low of Day” when referring to a stock.

When Scaling Beats Scanning
Nathan Bear on June 23, 2020 at 09:01 AM


If you’ve followed along recently, you know my focus has mostly been on a few stay-at-home stocks, like TDOC, or names that disconnected from the broader market, like bitcoin play RIOT.
In the process, a number of my new positions were smaller size, which is a trading strategy I recommend when there’s more uncertainty around a trade or the market in general. When I start with a small position, it gives me the opportunity to scale into a position over an extended period if the setup stays in place.
Getting into the habit of scaling into stocks that have strong setups can help traders maximize their returns. Given how much I’ve utilized this technique lately, I wanted to talk a little bit more about scaling into positions by going over some recent examples.


Scaling into a Position


Scaling can refer to scaling into a position or out of a position. Generally speaking, scaling into positions can allow traders to get a better entry point if the price moves lower after their initial purchase. It also limits risk because a trader is starting with a smaller-than-usual amount of money, meaning they’re not as exposed to a sudden drop in price. Think of it this way, if you’re generally putting 5% of your account into a trade, when you’re scaling in you may only start with 2% of your account instead.
That’s why scaling into a position is especially smart when there’s increased uncertainty, either because of the broader market, the particular setup of a trade, or if you’re planning to hold a position overnight when there’s a greater chance of market-moving news.
This concept is a bit easier to comprehend and execute for traders buying stock with a long-term outlook. Imagine you’re a trader with $1,000 to invest per position, and you want to start a position in AAPL. You buy 2 shares at $350, and one month later AAPL is down to $340, so you can scoop up some more shares at a discount to your initial purchase.
But we’re short-term traders here at LottoX, so I want to put the focus on adding to short-term option trades. I get the sense that too often traders will make a day trade and then think they’re “done” with that name, and move on to searching for other stocks to trade instead of staying focused on the best setups and adding more to the position.
Let’s take a look at a couple recent examples to see how I scaled into two trades with different time frames.

Quick Adds on NKLA

One good illustration of scaling into a trade quickly was on Monday when I bought calls on NKLA. The setup on the 78-minute chart was beautiful for NKLA. It had a monster TTM Squeeze and was consolidating right above the 21-unit exponential moving average (EMA).





As such, I grabbed 5 contracts of the June 26 $70 call Monday morning for $2.05. As I wrote in my alert at the time, this was a “half size” position to start.




Make sure you’re signed up for SMS alerts!


I was planning on adding more if the setup held, and it was less than an hour later when I added 5 more contracts of the same call options when their price dropped down to $1.90! This brought my average entry price down to $1.96 per contract.
Not long later, NKLA began moving sharply higher, and my June 26 $70 calls were valued at $3.60 at the close on Monday. If I hadn’t acted quickly on adding to NKLA, I would have had just my original small position in place and left money on the table.
From my view, nothing had changed on NKLA, but the calls had depreciated in value, so I was able to get extra value on my trade.
Not only that, but keeping my focus on NKLA eventually led me to opening multiple spread trades in Weekly Money Multiplier (I even picked up some NKLA stock). Trading the same stock multiple times may seem boring, but who cares if you’re making money?

Trading TW’s Dip

Another example I wanted to mention here is my long play on TW. I think this meshes well with my NKLA example because the same idea applies, except over a longer time frame.
I originally targeted TW last Thursday when there were multiple squeezes on various chart time frames, including its lovely daily chart. Since I was playing the daily chart, I knew this would be a longer-term type of LottoX trade, so I gave myself more time with the July 17 $65 calls. I picked up 20 contracts, which at the time were valued at $2.65.



TW daily as of 6/18


I held the calls over the weekend, and when Monday rolled around, TW shares dipped back to the 21EMA. The July 17 $65 call premiums dipped to $2.12, so I felt comfortable adding on that discount, with TW back in the buy zone and the setup still intact.
Since I’m playing the daily chart and July options with TW, I’m able to be a bit more patient with the trade -- a reminder that it’s important to remember what time frames you’re working with when scaling into a trade and adding to a position.
On the surface, this may not seem like groundbreaking stuff, but being willing to add to existing positions when the setup holds instead of just sitting on them or, even worse, selling because of slight weakness, is a critical part of being an active trader. While it’s always fun to search for new stocks to trade, sometimes the best setups are already in your portfolio.
Okay, gang, I’ll leave it there for now. Hopefully this helps you stay focused on the names that are working best in this market and gives you more confidence to stick with the best setups. Remember, you can see me trading live during my training sessions every Wednesday, so mark your calendars.
Stay safe out there.
