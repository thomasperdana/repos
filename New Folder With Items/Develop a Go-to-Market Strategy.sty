Develop a Go-to-Market Strategy

Prompt: Create a comprehensive Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy for a new product: [Insert Product Name + brief description], covering target audience identification (primary/secondary segments, demographics, psychographics, pain points, purchase triggers, and current solutions), a clear unique value proposition (key differentiators, features, benefits, messaging pillars, proof points), and competitive landscape analysis (direct, indirect, and substitute competitors with positioning, pricing, and tactical gaps). Recommend the most effective distribution channels (owned, earned, paid, and partnership opportunities) and outline stage-specific marketing tactics—from awareness (PR, content, influencers, ads) to consideration (demos, guides, case studies), conversion (retargeting, trials, offers), and retention/advocacy (referrals, upsells, community). Include measurable KPIs for each stage (CAC, MQLs, SQLs, LTV) and a feedback loop for optimization, ensuring the plan is concise, actionable, and supported with relevant examples.
